Click here!](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fimage.flaticon.com%2Ficons%2Fsvg%2F25%2F25231.svg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2Ffree-icon%2Fgithub-logo_25231&docid=DUAJHENWuAj-AM&tbnid=ZRPc5QkTPcqMLM%3A&w=438&h=438&bih=794&biw=1600&ved=0ahUKEwihwo341PXPAhWF2T4KHe23C3IQMwg_KAEwAQ&iact=mrc&uact=8)\r\n    * I suggest you use this method because it connects your GitHub and Cloud9 accounts.\r\n\r\n2) Fill in the information that is needed.\r\n* This includes: creating a username, entering your email address, and securing your account with a strong password.\r\n    * If you went to Cloud9 and signed up your GitHub account, go to the gear icon (in the top-right) and click \"Connected Services\" to make sure that your Cloud9 account is connected with your GitHub account. \r\n\r\n3) Verify your email by checking if GitHub sent you an email.\r\n\r\n### SSH Keys\r\n1) Make sure that you are signed into your GitHub account, but also have your Cloud9 account opened in another tab.\r\n\r\n2) On the top-right side of the webpage, click on your avatar/icon/profile picture.\r\n\r\n3) After, on the left side of the webpage, you will find a list called \"Personal settings\".\r\n\r\n4) In that list, you will find \"SSH and GPG keys\". When you do, click on it.\r\n\r\n5) Name your SSH key, \"cloud9\". Not your GPG.\r\n* Since it is case sensitive, that means that \"cloud9\" should be in **ALL LOWER CASE**\r\n\r\n6) Go to your Cloud 9 tab and click the gear icon that is on the top-right of the webpage.\r\n\r\n7) In the left side of the webpage, find \"SSH Keys\" and click it.\r\n\r\n8) Copy the long link that is in the darker-colored box. \r\n* It should have \"ssh-rsa\" in the beginning and your email in the end.\r\n\r\n9) Go back to your GitHub tab and paste your link.\r\n\r\n10) In the same tab, open \"github-learning IDE\".\r\n\r\n11) Type \"ssh -T git@github.com\" and press ENTER. (Side note: The link that you see here should not lead you to another page.)\r\n\r\n12) A message should pop up and confirm that you are \"successfully authenticated\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n1) Make sure that your GitHub and Cloud 9 accounts are open in separate tabs.\r\n\r\n2) In GitHub, click on the arrow that is next to your profile icon.\r\n\r\n3) Make sure that you created a folder, that there are files inside the folder, you are **INSIDE** a file of a folder, and initialized it. \r\n* Not sure how to do it? Go to \"Workflow & Commands\" section of the webpage that you are on right now!\r\n\r\n4) Click \"New repository\"\r\n\r\n5) Name your repository the same name of your folder. **SHOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME**\r\n* This is where your commit will be \"pushed into the cloud\".\r\n\r\n6) Click \"Create Repository\"\r\n\r\n7) Copy the **SSH** link that appears in your **GitHub** tab and paste it into your file in **Cloud9**.\r\n\r\n8) Repeat step 7, but with the links from the section where is says \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\". \r\n* I suggest you do this one at a time to see the difference in each of them.\r\n* By doing this, Cloud 9 will know where to push your commits.\r\n* After typing \"git push -u origin master\" and entering it once, you can just use \"git push -u\" the next time you commit because Cloud 9 would already knew where to push your commits after the first time.\r\n* **Every time before you push, make sure that you added your changes into the staging area and then commited them afterwards! Look at section \"Workflow & Commands\" (below this section).**\r\n\r\n9) Refresh your GitHub page to see your recent commit(s)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n* ``` git status ```\r\n    * This shows the differences of your branches. \r\n    * Changes that were added and commited vs. changes that were only added.\r\n\r\n* ``` git add ```\r\n    * This adds your change(s) into the staging area.\r\n    * I think of the staging area as a \"draft\" of what changes I might want to save/commit later on.\r\n\r\n* ``` git commit ```\r\n    * This is used to take a \"snapshot\" of what change(s) you made.\r\n    * When this is used, you can see your the changes that you added and commited in ``` git log ```.\r\n\r\n* ``` git push ```\r\n    * This uploads your commits into GitHub.\r\n    * It is useful because it help you secure your changes online.\r\n\r\n* ``` git log ``` \r\n    * This is used to see what changes have you made so far. It shows you the ones that were inserted and deleted.\r\n    * This is useful because you can look back at what changes you made and where you possibly messed up.\r\n\r\n",
